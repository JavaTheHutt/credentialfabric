# Credential Fabric Network

> This is an interactive, distributed, system for collecting all of your educational, industry and regulatory credentials in a combined ledger. Credential Authorities provided information on what credentials you have received, covering time span and expiration, where needed. Authorities are invited by the Member to add credentials and update for those that can expire. All Members can see general credential information. Members who wish to be considered to as candidates for employement, educational, training and other opportunities can invite Reviewers to view both basic and detailed credential information.
